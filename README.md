# Escape-From-The-Ship
This is a game that takes in a map of a building as input and returns a path to allow the player to escape.
The user has two options for how the escape route will be found. Both methods utilize a backtracking algorithm, however one uses a stack-based approach (LIFO) while the other uses a queue-based approach (FIFO).
I included a few sample maps to show what the input should look like.
